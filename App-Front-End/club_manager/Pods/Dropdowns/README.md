## Usage

`Dropdowns` provides the quickest way to present a dropdown in your app. It is very lightweight, just provide a list of items and the action closure you want to handle.

### Basic

`Dropdowns` works by showing a child `UIViewController` as a dropdown from a `TitleView`. The most common use case is to show from a `UINavigationController`, in that sense, you can just create a list of items, and provide to `TitleView`.

```swift
let items = ["World", "Sports", "Culture", "Business", "Travel"]
let titleView = TitleView(navigationController: navigationController!, title: "Menu", items: items)
titleView?.action = { [weak self] index in
  print("select \(index)")
}

navigationItem.titleView = titleView
```

### Customization

`Dropdowns` uses `TableController` by default, to show list of items in a `UITableView`. You can customise to show anything you want by using `contentController`.

```swift
let contentController = TableController(items: items, initialIndex: 0)
let dropdown = DropdownController(contentController: contentController, navigationController: navigationController)
```

### Configuration

You can also customise many aspects of `Dropdowns` via `Config`

```swift
Config.List.DefaultCell.Text.color = UIColor.redColor()
```
